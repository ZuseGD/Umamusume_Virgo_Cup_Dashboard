# Umamusume_Virgo_Cup_Dashboard
Moomoocows Community Data Dashboard 📊

Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for a data analytics and visualization suite designed for the Moomoocows gaming community. The project focuses on the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process of raw game telemetry and the generation of interactive dashboards to track player performance and community growth.

Key Features

Automated Data Cleaning: Scripts written in Python to handle missing values, outliers, and data normalization using pandas and NumPy.

Performance Metrics: Calculation of advanced gameplay statistics (e.g., win rates, resource efficiency) to derive predictive insights.

Visual Reporting: Generation of static and dynamic charts using Matplotlib and custom visualization tools to display trends over time.

Technical Stack

Language: Python 3.9+

Libraries: pandas (Data Manipulation), matplotlib / seaborn (Visualization), scikit-learn (Feature Extraction)

Concepts: Data Storytelling, Statistical Analysis, UX Design for Data

🚀 Excited to share my latest personal project: The Moomoocows Community Dashboard!

I combined my background in Cognitive Systems with technical skills in Python and Data Analytics to build a tool that helps gamers understand their performance data.

What it does:
✅ Ingests raw gameplay telemetry.
✅ Cleans and structures data using pandas.
✅ Visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to help players improve strategy.

This project sharpened my skills in building data pipelines and translating technical numbers into user-friendly insights. Check out the repo in the comments! 👇
