    **⚠️ Survivorship Bias Warning:**
    - This data is self-reported by the community.
    - Players who perform well (high win rates) are **more likely** to submit data than those who lose.
    - As the event progresses (Round 2), casual players may stop playing/reporting, artificially inflating the average skill level of the remaining pool.
    - *Take "Average Win Rates" as a benchmark for competitive players, not the entire player base.*
    """,
    "leaderboard": """
    **Ranking Logic:** Trainers are ranked by **Performance Score** (Win Rate × Log Volume).
    - This ensures high-volume winners rank above players with 1/1 wins.
    - *Note: Only Top 10 are named; others are anonymized.*
    """,

    **Spending vs Win Rate:**
    - Box Plot showing the distribution of win rates per spending tier.
    - *Box:* Middle 50% of players. *Line:* Median.

    **Meta Teams:**
    - Unique 3-Uma combinations used in a single session.
    - Only teams with >7 entries shown.

    **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**
    - Win Rate is based on the **TEAM'S** performance when this Uma was present.

    **Win Rate Distribution:**
    - **What it shows:** A histogram of all players' win rates.
    - **Interpretation:** Most players fall in the middle (Bell Curve). If you are on the far right, you are in the top percentile.
    """,
    "group_diff": """
    **Group Difficulty:**
    - **Metric:** Average Win Rate of all players within a specific CM Group.
    - **Goal:** To see which bracket was the most competitive. Lower average win rates usually indicate a harder group (players beating each other up).

    "leaderboard": """
    **Leaderboard Logic:**
    - **Score Formula:** `Win Rate * log(Total Races + 1)`
    - **Why?** This rewards players who maintain a high win rate over *many* races, rather than someone who went 1/1 (100%).

    "money": """
    **Spending vs. Performance:**
    - **Box Plot:** The box shows the middle 50% of players. The line in the middle is the median.

    "evolution": """
    **Meta Evolution:**
    - **What it shows:** How the popularity of the Top 5 teams changed across Rounds/Days.

    "style": """
    **Running Style:**

    **Luck vs. Grind:**
