The Oonige suzuka wasn't necessarily a problem, but if my Scarlet didn't try to overtake at the right time, she would be cooked and not be able to win at all. The other late surgers all had much higher power than mine, as well as both red shift and pump, meaning that it was super unlikely that my late surgers are able to contest.

The race started as expected, with my late surgers in the far back, and scarlet a little behind suzuka, and it stayed like that till the late race. As we were coming into the final corner, I see Scarlet fall back instead of push up, and immediately I realize that I'm screwed. Taiki and Mayano are pushing up super hard, and there's no way for Scarlet to get the rod if she's this far back, this late into the race. 

Then, as soon as it's too late, Scarlet pops her ult, and she stays in front of the pace chasers and is suddenly gaining on the suzuka. But the camera POV has already shifted, and the corner was already passed by the time she got neck and neck with her. Then, as they enter the straight, I see Angling and Scheming proc, and she rockets ahead, with the pace chasers already on her ass, but they never manage to gain on her. They have more speed, more power, and proc'd their accels at the perfect time, but Scarlet never lets them overtake, and its a dub for little miss perfect. Everything I know about this game, and the evidence from the past few days of this CM, tells me that she should've lost as soon as she fell back on the late race, but she just decided not to.

85% WR round 1  ( with a rank S silence suzuka runaway over my air groove)
65% WR Round 2 ( got destroyed )
i realised that my silence suzuka was blocking my summer maru from winning.
my original plan was to use a suzuka to, or win or kill the other suzukas, cleaning the path for my S maru to shine, i did some tests and it was working fine.
Well, forgot to considered the body count that my S maru would have to takeover
she could take 1 suzuka, but 2 or 3 got really hard for her.
my suzuka was good, dont get me wrong, shes the Ghost MVP of my team, but shes was really inconsistent against the GIGA taikis.
after i benched my suzuka in R2D2,  my WR got back to 85%, (one thoses tickes Smaru got a overwhleming peformace with 5 win ).
so i set my finals team with the air groove.
During the finals, i got late started, rushed and 2 suzukas blocking my Smaru
some how she got the W, i thought  spe chan would get the win since the 2 susuka blocked my rod. but Smaru is indeed a monster. she managed to get a 'Dueling' with the lead suzuka, killing her stamina.

ciao ciao, maruzenskYO

The winner had a Runaway Suzuka that was an ace. It made a huge gap and naturally the fronts and pacers pulled away from the lates because of it.

My Grass late started. I had 5th/6th locked down with Vodka/Ryan. 
Then on the very last moment before final leg, 3rd player's Ryan took 6th from mine and got pump.

My Vodka triggered Slick Surge and Pump soon after. 
Grass got Updrafters. 
Ryan got Slick Surge and but swung extremely wide on her own, everyone else inner lanes.

Opponent 1's Runaway Suzuka took Angling, but immediately fell back into Maru's path and she got NSM proc and that was game.

My Vodka did enough to overcome the Ryan's Pump and beat her, but no chance was she stopping a Maru who NSM'ed from a Runaway.

My Vodka has 1200+S/634/1177/421/480, 2x Right-Handed, 1x Fall Runner and finished 3/4L behind. She lost to this 4/60 winrate gamble.

Win Rates need to be segregated per Uma for the initial rounds. Maybe you can add a ""how many races did Uma 1 win option next to the Uma and her style selection.
2. Some people change Umas midway through rounds; so there needs to be an option to select more than 3 Umas for a particular round.
3. [If possible] Add an (optional) skill chart for Umas that people select for the rounds form (similar to how people would select skills for the umalator sim). That way, y'all can have more data to show which skills correspond to higher win rates [And how many BOFA demons there are] - maybe similar to the experimental OCR you're using right now.
4. Just like the support cards in this form, ask if people own the meta Umas. How many people own Taiki but did not use her. Something like that to differentiate people who don't have the meta Uma from those that do but do not want to use her. Idk, I think it'd be fun to visualise that data tbh.
5. Moomoocows should advertise it more. Shill for it in other communities - collab with other content creators, or at least ask them to advertise the form at least if possible - so that their viewers can hear about this and enter their data. The more data, the better it is to minimise outliers and randomness. 
6. I realise that I'm in the minority here, but google forms are really annoying for me because I do not use a google account at all. Therefore, the form having a mandatory sign in is cumbersome. But I do understand that you want to dissuade trolls from entering random data that an anonymous form would allow, and also to have form progress be saved after each day, so I'm not sure what the correct way to do it would be either. It's just annoying, but I get your position, so it's all g.

The point is that whaling causes, and having high LB SSR cards is the result of, pulling a lot from the support card banner.  It should also be a somewhat reliable measure of account strength as it is a decent estimator of how good a player's deck of SR cards is as well.  Also, there are regression techniques that can be used to see whether having a high level SSR card is actually predictive of performance or more just a side effect of having a generally strong stack of support cards (e.g., whales might have a lot of Biko Pegasus SSRs and that might result in Biko Pegasus SSR looking stronger than in reality.)

Lost first to the strangest vodka I have seen, they had stats (1200/1174, turf S but no mile S) but, a bunch of random skills. It had a 10/35.

Blocked sixth place, moved up on the final corner to around 3/5 then accelled with something?, got cut and drive and homestretched hasted a win (that, and they might have dueled with 600 vs 400 guts?).

I can only assume that that got their outer swell and updrafters / nimble navigator / corner acceleration at the corner perfectly, but there's no real way to tell since you don't see normal skill activation popups from opponents.

Either way, props to the player, won without any info and straight up gambled to victory like a true mile champion.

Also it was really funny to see both of the taikis fail.

The taiki on the same team as the vodka had 1200/436/1039/469/830. No accelerations outside of ult, and race planner and hydrate. 15/80 wins.

The other team member of the winner is a random Team Trials air groove, only that it isn't a TT uma but trained for this CM. 0/15 wins.

Maybe just as final result and not collecting for each round.

Based on the WR of each each round, you can calc if the player meet requirements for A group or B group, A final or B final. So user dont need to input that in (encourage people from group B enter the form. They only need to enter the results, instead of also have to input which group they are in).

I would be interested to see the diff (skills/stats) between group A and group B winner. On AVERAGE, is it RNG or that uma in group A is better (well i suspect the latter but data will tell).

Also it would be interest to see if moomoo strats (being mid but get just enough to win rounds and final) actually works (like how many user use it, which uma, how's the stats).

The guy who finished 3rd place re-used their Maruzensky (regular, not summer) from Leo cup (not Cancer, it had medium S and 900+ stam) that did not have groundwork or rod. They had a solid Vodka and good Taiki, but neither was optimized well with their skills. The guy who finished 2nd had very good umas - mile S on all 3 and uma stan on Curren/Taiki with superstan on Digitan. But same story with their skills. The only accels on the entire team were iron on Digitan, Curren/Taiki's own uniques, and ignited PWR on Curren.
For the race - it came down to the 3 Taikis at the very end. My Taiki was in 6th place with ~600m to go. She passed one Taiki to get to 5th and activated It's On! and SFV at the same time as they were rounding the corner. She got to 1st place by the time the corner was done, activated straight descent and head-on at the same time, and ended up beating the 2nd place Taiki by a head. 3rd place Taiki finished 3/4 L behind them, with my Taishin and then the Digitan neck and neck.
My Taiki was really good in round 1, I think she had 10 of my 18 wins across the 2 days. But she struggled a lot in round 2 and only picked up 3 wins in those 2 days, often coming in 2nd or 3rd place to better Taikis with mile S and similar skills. I was expecting the same in this race since she was stuck in 6th place until the last corner, but it seemed like absolute perfect activation for all of her late race skills to get me the win. Taishin was my MVP of the CM because of her round 2 wins, but she couldn't get good activation timing on nemesis/iron/red shift with 6 front/pace umas in the lobby. She still finished 4th anyway. We don't talk about my Falcon, she tried her best.",5,"Only things I can think of are individual uma win rates for each day/round, and something like tracking team composition day to day or round to round to see if/how people change strategies. For example, In R1D1 I used Falcon-Taiki-Taishin and did well enough. I used R1D2 to try out Taiki-Grass-Taishin and gamble more, but did worse overall and noticed that Taiki was losing to fronts more often. I figured that even when she wasn't winning, Falcon was effectively working as a blocker for non-runaway Suzuka fronts which made it easier for Taiki/Taishin to catch up and pass them. 
You guys do an awesome job and it's already much improved from the first form. This stuff just makes the CMs more fun.",I accept these terms

She didn't proc any other acceleration skills after this. Blockushin failed to overtake Seiun Sky in the final corner and the latter gained a massive distance, but once she reached top speed the rest seemed to be gaining on her pretty quickly. Vodka procced her ult followed by 1,500,000 CC and overtook Seiun Sky right before the finish line by a head length.

Additional Note:
- Vodka was the only one with Mile S in that lobby. The rest of the aces had max speed except for one Taiki Shuttle with 1195 speed and the Nice Nature with 1141 speed.
- The 2nd place Seiun Sky had 1000 power, only 500 wit and uses 2LB SSR tazuna + MLB SSR riko

Starting was fine, enemy S.Maru had no groundwork, so my Seiun and Maru were fighting eachother, after 1 early spot struggle, Seiun got absolutely demolished, despite activating 5 skills, she couldn't contest my Maru (4 skill activation before her ult). Despite Seiun Sky activating 5 skills and the winning Oguri activating 1 skill, she quickly caught up to the enemy Maru and my Seiun. Right before accel zone, Oguri activated Speed Star, carrying her speed, then she got blocked by my Seiun Sky right when accel zone started, activating No Stopping Me. Slightly after, the 6th placed Vodka who activated pump also got stuck on my Seiun Sky, activating No Stopping Me too. My Summer Maru who got no competition this race got absolutely demolished with her 0.2 accel vs enemy 0.4 accels. 
The guy who won only had no stopping me, angling and scheming on Maru and red shift on Vodka, no other viable accel skills.

Brian got stuck on the inner lane so her unique never procced, but OYL and updrafters both procced correctly thst allowed her to break through the inner lane anyways to win.

Curren got second so she would have won even if Brian didn't proc her accels. Using opposing Suzuka as a stepping stone for her unique has been very powerful this CM, and it happened in the finals too.

Brian took about 30 runs to accomplish due to the difficulty of hitting stat benchmarks while having enough stamina to get first in spring tenno sho. She's very strong in theory but in practice that one race means her stats suffer abit due to the need to emphasise stamina and guts early on, so when I got this Brian I ended my ace runs despite no max speed.

In contrast, Curren took just 3 runs.
